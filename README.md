# Webcam

Simple Webcam Streaming with OpenCV and UDP using Python.

Test with Python 3.7.3, OpenCV 4.1.0

There are still some issues:

1. a flicker at second frame ??? (bottom part of the image)
2. flickering when draging the frame window for the first time???
3. not tolerable to data lost (should generate packet loss to simulate the test)
