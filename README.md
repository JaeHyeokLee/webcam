# Webcam

Simple Webcam Streaming with OpenCV and UDP using Python.

Test with Python3.7.3 OpenCV4.1.0

There are still some issue to be solved:

1. a flicker at first frame ??? (bottom part of the image)
2. flickering when moving the frame window ???
3. current method seems more suitable for tcp
4. not very tolerable for data lost (should generate packet loss to simulate the test)
